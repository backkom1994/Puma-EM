1. Requirements for Running the Puma-EM Programs
------------------------------------------------

Prior to running Puma-EM, there is a serie of libraries/programs that need 
to be installed. All these libraries/programs are released under Open-Source
licences. Before compiling them, first look if it exists as a package for
your distribution.

  1) gmsh, a three-dimensional finite element mesh generator, available at
     http://www.geuz.org/gmsh/.

  2) g++ and gfortran compilers.

  3) The Blitz++ library, a C++ fast Array library, available at
     http://www.oonumerics.org/blitz/

  4) NumPy and SciPy (both available at http://www.scipy.org/).

  5) matplotlib for plotting, available at http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/

  6) Open-MPI, the future replacement of LAM/MPI. Puma-EM can run on both
     Environments. See http://www.open-mpi.org/

     We recommend the use of Open-MPI, as it does not suffer from annoying
     LAM/MPI bugs, such as the infamous "(set_stdio): Too many files 
     open in system" that happens when you don't reset lamd often enough.

  7) mpi4py, MPI for Python, available at http://www.scipy.org/

     Please note that the MPI environment has to be installed prior to 
     compiling and installing mpi4py. mpi4py compiled on LAM/MPI env
     will not work within Open-MPI environment, and vice-versa.

The scripts in this directory should help you to install Puma-EM dependencies. 
I recommend you to take a look at them, as they may make your life easier.


1.1 Ubuntu/Debian
-----------------
Typically, for Ubuntu/Debian flavors, most of these packages are available 
through the package manager. Try a search by name through the package manager.

1.2 RedHat / Fedora / CentOS
----------------------------
Starting from FC18, Support for Fedora automated scripts has dropped, in part due  
to the extremely difficult installation procedure (disk partitioning mess). Try searching the 
packages by name, and when it fails, check the installation procedure in the user guide.
