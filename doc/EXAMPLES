0. Example 0: Calculating the scattered E-Field at one point in space
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The goal here is to run the MLFMA code without modifications to the parameters files.

At a terminal, type:

    $ ./run.sh

Choose your number of processes when asked (1 is default).

As the last lines of the output you should obtain (values are approximative):

""" BEGIN QUOTE """

MLFMA E_field =
[[ 0.04378190+0.16912299j  0.10270200+0.00177715j -0.00076295-0.00149393j]
 [-0.17377700-0.00280692j -0.02891280+0.0980397j   0.00162679-0.00033434j]]


at observation points r_obs =
[[  0.1          0.1         20. ]
 [  0.1          0.1         20.1]]

See 'E_obs.txt' and 'r_obs.txt' in './result' directory for the results of the computation, where you will also find the far field values.

""" END QUOTE """

See "simulation_parameters.py" for details about the simulations settings.


1. Example 1: same as example 0 but with other simulation settings
------------------------------------------------------------------

Let's pretend we are interested by the scattering from the NASA almond at 
some point in space (the NASA almond is available in the geo directory of
the package), for a 3.34 GHz frequency.

The script used for this kind of calculations is "RCS_MLFMA.py". You don't 
need to open it. Just open "simulation_parameters.py".

We first have to write in "simulation_parameters.py" that our target will be 
the almond:

    params_simu.targetName = 'EMCC_almond'

(Do not include a tab in the "simulation_parameters.py" file, or python will complain.)
Next, we can redefine the frequency:

    params_simu.f = 3.34e9

Finally, we need to set up the source and observation points, along with 
the directions of the source and the observation vectors:

    params_simu.EXCITATION = 'dipole'
    params_simu.J_src_x = 10.0+0.j
    params_simu.J_src_y = 0.0+0.j
    params_simu.J_src_z = 0.0+0.j
    params_simu.r_J_src_x = 0.6
    params_simu.r_J_src_y = 3.1
    params_simu.r_J_src_z = 40.0

    # sampling of the resulting field at some point in space
    params_simu.r_obs_x = 0.1
    params_simu.r_obs_y = 0.1
    params_simu.r_obs_z = 20.0

Now, save "simulation_parameters.py" and at a terminal, type:

    $ ./run.sh

At the end of the simulation, the final lines read like:

    MLFMA E_field =
    [[E1, E2, E3]
     [E4, E5, E6]
     ...
     [.., .., ..]]

    at observation points r_obs =
    [[r1, r2, r3]
     [r4, r5, r6]
     ...
     [.., .., ..]]

Note that, by default, after the simulation the parameters are saved 
in a file called "result/simulation_parameters.txt".


2. Example 2: performing a Volakis test of the code or RCS computation
----------------------------------------------------------------------

This example basically shows you how to perform a monostatic RCS computation.

With the "parameters/RCS_parameters.py" parameters file you can perform 
Volakis testing of the code. For more info about the tests, see:
[1] A.C. Woo et al., "Benchmark Plate Radar Targets for the Validation
    of Computational Electromagnetics Programs", IEEE Antennas and 
    Propagation Magazine, Vol. 34, No. 6, December 1992
[2] A.C. Woo et al., "Benchmark Radar Targets for the Validation
    of Computational Electromagnetics Programs", IEEE Antennas and 
    Propagation Magazine, Vol. 35, No. 1, February 1993

There are tests on 2 types of targets: plane targets and 3D targets.
These targets have been defined by the Electromagnetic Code Consortium.

Most (not all) of the EMCC targets described in [1], [2] have been implemented 
and are in the "Puma-EM/geo" directory:
  - EMCC plate targets = EMCC_plate-cylinder_plate, EMCC_wedge-cylinder_plate, 
                         EMCC_wedge-plate-cylinder_plate
  - EMCC 3D targets = EMCC_almond, EMCC_cone-gap-sphere, EMCC_cone-sphere, EMCC_double-ogive, 
                      EMCC_ogive

First choose params_simu.targetName = EMCC_target_name. Then, set your own desired frequency.

The frequency doesn't matter for plate targets, as their dimensions are calculated in wavelengths.

For the 3D targets, the frequencies used in [2] are:
  - 1.19 GHz, 7 GHz and 9.92 GHz for the almond
  - 1.18 GHz and 9 GHz for the ogive
  - 1.57 GHz and 9 GHz for the double ogive
  - 0.869 GHz and 9 GHz for the cone-sphere and the cone-gap-sphere

Also set:
params_simu.BISTATIC = 0
params_simu.MONOSTATIC_RCS = 1

and also:
params_simu.STOP_PHI = pi

also set params_simu.SHOW_FIGURE to 1, for viewing the RCS of the target.

After you have chosen your options in the "simulation_parameters.py", save and type in a terminal:

    $ ./run.sh

The simulation should end with a graph that shows the RCS of your chosen target at the frequency you specified.


3. Example 3: increasing the size of the target
-----------------------------------------------

Now revert back to the original MLFMA parameters of example 0. We will now increase the size
of the "cubi" target so that the number of unknowns grows steadily. You can compare your result
to the one listed here. Just modify parameters/simulation_parameters as follows:

params_simu.lx = x
params_simu.ly = x
params_simu.lz = x

where x is successively equal to 0.5, 1., 1.5, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0

The E_x field that you should obtain (approximately) for each of these values is listed hereafter:
0.5: 1.07032+1.22188j, N_RWG = 16,837
1.0: -11.4244-7.55185j, N_RWG = 64,634
1.5: 4.04456+3.62044j, N_RWG = 146,808
2.0: -2.11902e+01+4.7244j, N_RWG = 264,385
3.0: -6.8559600-3.75964j, N_RWG = 583,099
